<h2>Client: Vista Computer Repair</h2>  
<h2>Project: Website Redesign</h2>
<h2>Designer: Michael Essien</h2> 
<h2>Document: Project Analysis</h2>

<h3>Site Intent:</h3> <p>The Vista Computer Repair website intends to offer its clients
various essential computer repair services. With the current design, these goals are
hardly being met. The only good thing, call-to-action-wise is the fact that their phone
number is clearly visible on every page so if the company gets any business at all, I
would attribute it to this. Apart from that, the company is missing out on several
opportunities for revenue and it is my ultimate goal to realize these goals opportunities
with my redesign. Also the UI is not pleasant to look at due to the very poor background
image choice resulting in poor contrast.</p>

<p>I intend to increase web traffic and consequently conversion rate by refining the IA,
reorganize the content and replace current one with a more appealing, less cluttered UI
which is less painful to look at and finally get the clients to fill out a service request
form, which currently not present on the site. I will also condense the sites content from
the current 11 pages to 6 main pages which still cover the sites objectives. 6 more
focused categories should make it easy for the client to find the service they seek and
also make their browsing experience a better one since they don't have to figure or guess
where to find which type of service and hence increasing the number of repeat
customers.</p>

<p>Current site not Responsive or Mobile Enabled</p>

<h3>Competitive Analysis:</h3> <p>My little research, using godaddy.com's WHOIS search,
google search to verify Windows Vista's release date, I was convinced that client may have
decided to use the domain name www.vistacomputerrepair.com and registered it in 2007 when
Windows Vista was released and the name "vista" was huge buzzword. Given the heartaches
that Windows Vista eventually brought people, "vista" in my opinion, ceases to be a good
marketing buzzword and will therefore highly recommend to the client that he changes his
business name as well as domain name. This step is aimed at helping the business gain back
some confidence from it's customer or potential customers and therefore translate into
profits in the long run. </p> <p> Some competitors with similar markets and goals are Geek
Squad and 247techies.com </p> <p>I will urge my client to seriously consider including
services completely deliverable over the internet as part of its service offerings, just
like 247techies.com offers
currently. </p>

<h3>Website Keywords:</h3> 
<p>The current keywords used for this site are; Orlando
Computer Repair, laptop repair, computer repair Orlando, Hotel computer repair, Wireless
networking, Laptop Screens.
</p>

<p>Other important keywords I will recommend, include; </p>
